\begin{definition}[Field]\index{ring theory!field}
	A commutative division ring is called a \df{field}. That is, a 
	field is a set $F$ together with two binary operations + and 
	$\cdot$ on $F$ such that $(F,+)$ is an abelian group (call its 
	identity 0) and $(F \setminus \{ 0 \}, \cdot)$ is also an 
	abelian group, and the following \df{distributive} law holds:
	\[
		a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)\,,
		\quad \text{ for all } a,b,c \in F\,.
	\]
